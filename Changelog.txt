VERSION 1.0
- Initial version
===================================================================================================
VERSION 1.1

Changes:
- Disabled surface area calculation pending calculation optimizations
- Realistic grains calculations of the convex hull added to improve results.

Fixes:
- First a bug where fining and coarsening upward where switched.
- Fining upward had a bug that resulted in a very small grain at the last depeosition step for the grain group.
- Fixed a bug in coloring grains based on size.

Addition:
- PDF data is normalized automatically now to prevent issues.
===================================================================================================
Version 1.2

Changes:
- Automatic rescaling of contianer algorithm changed.

Fixes:

Addition:
- Keyboard shortcut P: toggle white and black background for publications. Added the background color in the parameter file. This is a breaking change. Old parameter files will need to be updated manually.
- Keybaord shortcut O: toggle box visiblity for publications.
- Fixed spelling mistakes with the parameters files (Bounce Threshold, Shake Transversely, Shaking Fraction, Shaking Rotation). This is a breaking change. Old parameter files will need to be updated manually.
- Added Cube grains. No parameters are needed.
- Added DeformedCube grains. The parameters for these are similar to the realistic grains.
